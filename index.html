<p>This is a library that defines common error values for all GnuPG
components.  Among these are GPG, GPGSM, GPGME, GPG-Agent, libgcrypt,
Libksba, DirMngr, Pinentry, SmartCard Daemon and more.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Please read the file INSTALL!</p>

<p>Here is a quick summary:</p>

<p>1) Check that you have unmodified sources.  You can find instructions
   how to verify the sources below.  Don't skip this - it is an
   important step!</p>

<p>2) Unpack the archive.  With GNU tar you can do it this way:
   "tar xjvf libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2"</p>

<p>3) "cd libgpg-error-x.y"</p>

<p>4) "./configure"</p>

<p>5) "make"</p>

<p>6) "make install"</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-verify-the-source" class="anchor" href="#how-to-verify-the-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Verify the Source</h2>

<p>In order to check that the version of libgpg-error which you are going
to install is an original and unmodified copy of the original, you can
do it in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>a) If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you can
   simply check the supplied signature:</p>

<p>$ gpg --verify libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.sig</p>

<p>This checks that the detached signature libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.sig
   is indeed a a signature of libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.</p>

<p>Please note that you have to use an old version of GnuPG to do all
   this stuff.  <em>Never</em> use the version which was built using the
   library you are trying to verify!</p>

<p>b) If you don't have any a trusted version of GnuPG, you can attempt
   to verify the SHA1 checksum, using a trusted version of the sha1sum
   program:</p>

<p>$ sha1sum libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2</p>

<p>This should yield an output <em>similar</em> to this:</p>

<p>610064e5b77700f5771c8fde2691c4365e1ca100  libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2</p>

<p>Now check that this checksum is <em>exactly</em> the same as the one
   published via the announcement list and probably via Usenet.</p>

<h2>
<a name="hints" class="anchor" href="#hints"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hints</h2>

<p>To build for Windows you you may use the convenience command:</p>

<p>./autogen.sh --build-w32</p>

<p>which runs configure with suitable options.  For WindowsCE the command
is:</p>

<p>./autogen.sh --build-w32ce</p>

<h2>
<a name="known-problems" class="anchor" href="#known-problems"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known Problems</h2>

<p>On Windows, WSA Error Codes can be provided as system error codes and
will be transparently converted to the corresponding gpg error codes.
There are two problems with this support:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not all error codes corresponding to WSA Error codes have a detailed
description when printed with gpg_strerror.  Some will default to
"Unknown error" for pretty printing.  For example, WSAEHOSTDOWN will
be translated to GPG_ERR_EHOSTDOWN, but there is no corresponding
EHOSTDOWN in Windows and thus gpg_strerror will default to "Unknown
error" as printed by the system's strerror function for the argument
WSAEHOSTDOWN.  (This could be fixed by adding our own error strings
replacing or extending the system error strings, including their
translations).</p></li>
<li><p>The translation to a gpg error code and back to a system error code
in some cases does not preserve information.  For example, the error code
WSAEACCES translates to GPG_ERR_EACCES, which translates back to
EACCES.</p></li>
</ul><p>Any WSA Error code has either the first problem or the second (but not
both), depending on if there is a corresponding Windows error code.</p>
