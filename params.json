{"name":"Libgpg-error","tagline":"","body":"libgpg-error\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a library that defines common error values for all GnuPG\r\ncomponents.  Among these are GPG, GPGSM, GPGME, GPG-Agent, libgcrypt,\r\nLibksba, DirMngr, Pinentry, SmartCard Daemon and more.\r\n\r\nlibgpg-error is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the\r\nLicense, or (at your option) any later version.  See the file\r\nCOPYING.LIB for copyright and warranty information.\r\n\r\nHowever, some files (for example src/mkerrnos.awk) used in the build\r\nprocess of the library are covered by a different license.  Please see\r\nthe header of these files and the file COPYING for copyright and\r\nwarranty information on these files.  A special exception in the\r\ncopyright license of these files makes sure that the output in the\r\nbuild process, which is used in libgpg-error, is not affected by the\r\nGPL.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease read the file INSTALL!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick summary:\r\n\r\n1) Check that you have unmodified sources.  You can find instructions\r\n   how to verify the sources below.  Don't skip this - it is an\r\n   important step!\r\n\r\n2) Unpack the archive.  With GNU tar you can do it this way:\r\n   \"tar xjvf libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2\"\r\n\r\n3) \"cd libgpg-error-x.y\"\r\n\r\n4) \"./configure\"\r\n\r\n5) \"make\"\r\n\r\n6) \"make install\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Verify the Source\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nIn order to check that the version of libgpg-error which you are going\r\nto install is an original and unmodified copy of the original, you can\r\ndo it in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\na) If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you can\r\n   simply check the supplied signature:\r\n\r\n   $ gpg --verify libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.sig\r\n\r\n   This checks that the detached signature libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.sig\r\n   is indeed a a signature of libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2.\r\n\r\n   Please note that you have to use an old version of GnuPG to do all\r\n   this stuff.  *Never* use the version which was built using the\r\n   library you are trying to verify!\r\n\r\nb) If you don't have any a trusted version of GnuPG, you can attempt\r\n   to verify the SHA1 checksum, using a trusted version of the sha1sum\r\n   program:\r\n\r\n   $ sha1sum libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2\r\n\r\n   This should yield an output _similar_ to this:\r\n\r\n   610064e5b77700f5771c8fde2691c4365e1ca100  libgpg-error-x.y.tar.bz2\r\n\r\n   Now check that this checksum is _exactly_ the same as the one\r\n   published via the announcement list and probably via Usenet.\r\n\r\n\r\nHints\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo build for Windows you you may use the convenience command:\r\n\r\n   ./autogen.sh --build-w32\r\n\r\nwhich runs configure with suitable options.  For WindowsCE the command\r\nis:\r\n\r\n   ./autogen.sh --build-w32ce\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Problems\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOn Windows, WSA Error Codes can be provided as system error codes and\r\nwill be transparently converted to the corresponding gpg error codes.\r\nThere are two problems with this support:\r\n\r\n* Not all error codes corresponding to WSA Error codes have a detailed\r\n  description when printed with gpg_strerror.  Some will default to\r\n  \"Unknown error\" for pretty printing.  For example, WSAEHOSTDOWN will\r\n  be translated to GPG_ERR_EHOSTDOWN, but there is no corresponding\r\n  EHOSTDOWN in Windows and thus gpg_strerror will default to \"Unknown\r\n  error\" as printed by the system's strerror function for the argument\r\n  WSAEHOSTDOWN.  (This could be fixed by adding our own error strings\r\n  replacing or extending the system error strings, including their\r\n  translations).\r\n\r\n* The translation to a gpg error code and back to a system error code\r\n  in some cases does not preserve information.  For example, the error code\r\n  WSAEACCES translates to GPG_ERR_EACCES, which translates back to\r\n  EACCES.\r\n\r\nAny WSA Error code has either the first problem or the second (but not\r\nboth), depending on if there is a corresponding Windows error code.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
